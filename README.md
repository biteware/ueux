<h1 align="center">Hello Stranger!</h2>

<p>Hi I'm <b>@bytecache</b>. I'm a software developer who works primarily with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> in the space of distributed development - which is a fancy way of saying I write code that hopefully won't fall over under high load or network issues. 

<p>I'm currently focused on learning more about <b>ðŸ–§ Distributed Systems</b> and <b>ðŸ”’ Information Security</b> If any of these are areas you would like to connect and talk about, please get in touch!</p>
